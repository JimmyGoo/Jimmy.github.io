					Design or Skill? Should a software engineer learn designing technique?
				</p>
				<p class='pbody'>
					It is my first time to bulid my own web, and I have some feeling and ideas to  share with you as I start learning front-end development.
				</p>
				<p class='pbody'>
					As a beginner, the first thing I learn is the basic programming rule of html and css.
					Concept like label is fresh to me but it is easy to handle as I can the grammer in website such as w3school. I put almost everything I know to make the web look better. Building a web page didn't cost a lot of time and I finish building the homepage in couple of hours. But as I use safari to open it, images and texts bunched together, making the whole page messy and terrible. Obviously, my first work failed and I realized I had to find out a good design pattern.
				</p>
				<p p class='pbody'>
					So, I searched google with "perfect personal web design". I saw several webs it recommended and they were really fantastic. Those webs, using bright color as its background color as well as smooth font with suitable size, looked brilliant. It was a feast to surf them and you never felt boring. As a result, I learn to develop my own web with similar pattern and it turned out to be much better than before. Such experience help me realize the importance of designing.
				</p> 
				<p class='pbody'>
					Lastly, I strongly recommend designing web canvas to you, it help you design better!
